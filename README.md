# The official starter repository for the Rock the JVM Akka Persistence with Scala course

This repository contains the starter code for the [Rock the JVM's Akka Persistence with Scala](https://www.udemy.com/akka-persistence) course on Udemy.

### How to install
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project

No need to do anything else, as the IDE will take care to download and apply the appropriate library dependencies.

### The complete code

The repository for the completed code is [here](https://github.com/rockthejvm/udemy-akka-persistence). You can follow the instructions there - although the download/import steps are identical to this one. Additionally, the completed repo is enhanced with commit tags that allow you to go back to an earlier state of the repository, prior to each lecture.
